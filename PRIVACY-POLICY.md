# **Privacy Policy — VTIL Private Operations**
_Last updated: 01/16/2026_

VTIL Private Operations (“we”, “our”, or “the Project”) is committed to respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected when you interact with our GitHub repositories, tools, or related services.

## 1. Information We Collect
- **Information you voluntarily provide**: Such as issues, pull requests, comments, or other contributions you make on GitHub.
- **Technical information automatically collected**: GitHub may collect metadata such as IP addresses, browser type, and usage analytics. This data is governed by GitHub’s own privacy policy.
- **Project‑specific data**: If the project includes optional features (e.g., APIs, scripts, or tools), they may collect logs or configuration data strictly for functionality or debugging.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
- **To maintain and improve the project**  
- **To communicate about issues, updates, or contributions**  
- **To ensure security, prevent abuse, and debug problems**  

We do **not** sell or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or commercial purposes.

## 3. Open‑Source Transparency
- **All contributions are public**: Any information you submit to the repository (issues, PRs, comments) becomes publicly visible.
- **Code and logs may be visible to maintainers**: Only for operational or debugging purposes.

## 4. Third‑Party Services
VTIL Private Operations relies on GitHub and possibly other external tools. Their privacy policies apply independently:
- **GitHub Privacy Statement**  
- **Any additional third‑party integrations you use**  

## 5. Data Security
- **We use GitHub’s built‑in security features**  
- **We limit access to sensitive project data to authorized maintainers**  

However, no system is perfectly secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
- **The project is not intended for children under 13**  
We do not knowingly collect information from minors.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
- **We may update this Privacy Policy periodically**  
Changes will be posted in the repository with an updated revision date.

## 8. Contact
For questions or concerns, open an issue in the repository or contact the maintainers directly.
